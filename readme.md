  - [ ] number
  - [ ] email
  - [ ] checkbox
  - [ ] radio
  - [ ] password

- You should use every of this attribute at least one time
  - [ ] required
  - [ ] min
  - [ ] max
  - [ ] minlength
  - [ ] maxlength
  - [ ] multiple
- The number field should have default value: `12` and maximum value 100.
- The email field should have placeholder value: `email@example.com`.
- The text fields should have disabled autocomplete.
- Add a button which submits the form.
- Add `onsubmit="onSubmit()"` attribute to `form` tag to show form value on submit
- Vertical distance between inputs should be `10px`
